# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.  
The goal is to build a simple recipe website using only HTML.

By the end of this project, I will have practiced:
- Creating and structuring HTML pages
- Using lists, links, images, and headings
- Organizing a multi-page website with relative links

This project will help reinforce the fundamentals of HTML before moving into CSS and JavaScript.
