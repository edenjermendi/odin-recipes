            <li>Cut the pumpkin into 3cm slices. Cut the skin off and scrape seeds out. Cut into 4cm chunks.</li>
            <li>Place the pumpkin, onion, garlic, broth and water in a pot - liquid won't quite cover all the pumpkin. Bring to a boil, uncovered, then reduce heat and let simmer rapidly until pumpkin is tender (check with butter knife) - about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and use a stick blender to blend until smooth (Note 3 for blender).</li>
            <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper, stir through cream (never boil soup after adding cream, cream will split). </li>
            <li>Ladle soup into bowls, drizzle over a bit of cream, sprinkle with pepper and parsley if desired. Serve with crusty bread!</li>
        </ol>
